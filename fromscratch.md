From Scratch is where I explore the craft of software and the human side of belonging, neurodivergence, and self-employment.

## [From Scratch Code](https://fromscratchcode.com/)

I teach the craft of writing software from the ground up through mentorship, courses, and hands-on projects in Rust and Python. I'm also building an open-source Python interpreter in Rust from scratch, known as [Memphis](https://github.com/JonesBeach/memphis), to share my learnings.

Through essays, memoir, and fiction, I write about life beyond the 9-5, exploring independence, creativity, and what it means to belong. My piece, [Why I left my 9-5 for good](https://fromscratchdotorg.substack.com/p/why-i-left-my-9-5-for-good), is a great place to start.
