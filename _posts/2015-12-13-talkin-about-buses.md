It&#8217;s hard to trace my interest in public transportation to any single moment, but one certainly stands tall among the rest. The date was Wednesday, February 12, 2014. The location: <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/fiesta-mexican-grill-west-lafayette" target="_blank">Fiesta Mexican Grill</a>, on the banks of the Wabash, West Lafayette, Indiana. Before we revisit the modern era timeline, a little blast from the past&#8230;

* * *

The earliest known artifact of my enthusiasm for public transit is from April 2001. The pictures below were captured on the first of three family vacations to Washington, D.C. I include the second photo because 1) a picture of my dad and a young me on a subway is something I now treasure, and 2) to show I was actually wearing jeans and not just a one-piece Kentucky dress. You can see the pre-Silver Line WMATA map on the wall, the pre-SmarTrip farecard in my hand, and absolutely nothing outside the train window (#subway). And to think we took these photos to finish a roll of film&#8230;

Fast forward more than a decade, and my enthusiasm for transit was beginning to see several key growth points.

I&#8217;d made jokes about starting a website called Rapid Transit Fanatic (a spin-off of the wildly unpopular and under-developed <a href="http://www.stadiumfanatic.com/" target="_blank">Stadium Fanatic</a>). (I have since updated the name of this fictional website to <a href="https://twitter.com/tgreen8091/status/473145202798886912" target="_blank">Public Transit Fanatic</a>.)

I&#8217;d bought a shower curtain adorned with the WMATA map, the official guide to DC&#8217;s metro system (also pre-Silver Line, you&#8217;ll notice).

I took a trip by rail to Chicago and even traveled to Minneapolis to experience their light rail and bus system. But on 2/12/14, transit reached a new level for me. One might say the bus left the station.

* * *

I was relaying to <a href="https://twitter.com/yothere" target="_blank">my friend Hector</a> how I had plans to get coffee with a girl I had met at a recent party. He assumed we had been communicating frequently in the few weeks since meeting.

> **Hector**: So you&#8217;ve been talking to this girl?
> 
> **Me** (_slowly shakes head):_ Nope. But! We had a great conversation at the party about public transportation.
> 
> **Hector** (_stares at me, tilts his chin down and eyebrows up, flicks his right hand out in a demonstrative manner_): You talked about buses???

I almost fell out of my burrito shop chair. Hector is from Florida. To him, &#8220;public transportation&#8221; meant &#8220;buses&#8221;. His always-charismatic demeanor shown through in an expression of genuine confusion that would alter the direction of my life. Or at least what I took pictures with.

A few days later, we made a meme of the event.

The day after that, we practiced meme-ception.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-331 size-large" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.tyleragreen.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMAG1062-579x1024.jpg?fit=579%2C1024" alt="IMAG1062" data-recalc-dims="1" />

Hector received loads of positive feedback about the meme from friends and family who had decidedly no idea what it meant. Our friend <a href="http://www.calvinholic.com/" target="_blank">Calvin</a> picked up the phrase, changed the tense, and made sure we all used it anytime a new subject was brought up. Hang around our group for more than five minutes, and it was likely that you would have heard the following:

> _So&#8230;you&#8217;re talkin&#8217; about buses?_

We quickly began to use the phrase in loosely-related contexts. As computer engineers, one of my favorites was, &#8220;So&#8230;you&#8217;re talkin&#8217; about on-chip buses?&#8221;, referring to one type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)" target="_blank">communication system within a computer</a>. I also recall being asked, &#8220;You&#8217;re talkin&#8217; about clydesdales?&#8221; and &#8220;You&#8217;re talkin&#8217; about sidewalks?&#8221; at different points. Our variations on a theme emphasized the variation part much heavier than the theme part.

* * *

We had developed more than a simple tag line to use lightly in conversation. It had taken on a life of its own.

I began taking pictures with bus signs. (Major props to Calvin for getting the bus in the background&#8230;and don&#8217;t think it wasn&#8217;t intentional.)

I began getting on random campus bus loops and seeing where they would take me.

I began using buses more when I visited cities, whereas I previously used mostly rail.

I began riding the bus to work.

I started a meetup whose recurring event is called &#8220;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/FortCollinsPublicTransit/" target="_blank">Let&#8217;s Talk About Buses</a>&#8220;.

And I recently started a YouTube channel where I literally talk about buses.



I still get Facebook comments from friends I never remember talking about buses with that say nothing more than, &#8220;So you&#8217;re talkin&#8217; about buses?&#8221;

So if you have ever seen my tweets or blog posts and wondered what the strange fascination with buses was about, now you know.

Speaking of that, care to <a href="http://www.tyleragreen.com/contact/" target="_blank">talk about buses</a>?

P.S. &#8211; Hector will be a guest on an upcoming #TylerTalksTransit episode! Follow along on <a href="http://twitter.com/tgreen8091" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/+TylerAGreen" target="_blank">YouTube</a> to learn when you can view it.
