Each February, a few Purdue friends and I make our way to Navy Pier for <a href="http://www.cidersummitnw.com/chicagoeventinfo.html" target="_blank">Cider Summit Chicago</a>.Â This was our third year of sampling fermented apples, and my second of making the weekend trip from Colorado to Chicago. I've included a few photos from the fantastic weekend below! They can be reasonably categorized into the following: airports, Chicago, Chicago transit, friends, friends on transit, transit in airports, and waffles.

Until next year, Cider Up! Oh, and ride on.
