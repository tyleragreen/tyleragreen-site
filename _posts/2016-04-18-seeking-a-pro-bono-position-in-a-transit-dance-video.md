  <strong>Objective</strong>
</h4>

I am seeking a pro bono* position in a transit dance video. I intend to use my <a href="https://twitter.com/greent_tyler/status/647107323417202688" target="_blank">multi</a>&#8211;<a href="https://twitter.com/greent_tyler/status/645753006420586496" target="_blank">modal</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/greent_tyler/status/681567373439021060" target="_blank">excitement</a> to raise awareness, excitement, and ridership of American transit systems. Please contact me if you are in need of someone who can learn dance steps on bus steps. Let&#8217;s make transit more visible, safer, and more fun!

  <strong>Experience</strong>
</h4>

**DanceBlue, University of Kentucky Dance Marathon**
  
Lexington, KY
  
February 2013

I&#8217;m the one in the white.

Actually, I may have been wearing blue. We&#8217;d been dancing for 23.5 hours at point.



**Purdue Night Train Swing Dance Club**
  
West Lafayette, IN
  
August 2013 &#8211; December 2014

If you didn&#8217;t get a great sampling of my individual skill from DanceBlue, the following video shows my full repertoire of lindy hop moves and my ability to seemingly read them off the ceiling.



<h4 style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>Skills</strong>
</h4>

  * Well-versed at managing life with awkward arms
  * Experience at walking on beat for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0Xe92S_Ppo" target="_blank">minutes at a time</a>
  * Ability to provide vision for groups of people though bus windows

<h4 style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>Influences</strong>
</h4>

I consider the following two videos required viewing for all participants in my future transit dance videos.

**Silver Line Opening**
  
Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority

The guy who opens the video inspires me. His energy walking down a suburban street to a train is infectious. I&#8217;m moving my shoulders like that right now. You too?

Let&#8217;s match (or exceed) this.



**Virgin American Safety Video**
  
The airline formerly known as Virgin America

My own flight on Virgin, I was literally grinning ear-to-ear the five minutes before the boarding door closed and the following video is the reason why. I&#8217;m not sure whether I love the lyrics or choreography more. &#8220;So tonight, get ready to fly, cuz we&#8217;re gonna live it on up in the sky&#8221;? Genius.

I know this isn&#8217;t _public_ transit, but they move people and this video moves me. I hope the Alaskan Airlines&#8217; dancers are stretching and their choreographer is being inspired as we speak.

Let&#8217;s match (or exceed) this.

  <strong>Contact</strong>

If you are a transit agency producing promotional media, <a href="http://www.tyleragreen.com/contact/" target="_blank">contact me</a> and we&#8217;ll talk.

If you are an enthusiastic transit rider, <a href="http://www.tyleragreen.com/contact/" target="_blank">let&#8217;s brainstorm</a>.

Either way, **see you on the rails.**

* The pro bono part is negotiable.
