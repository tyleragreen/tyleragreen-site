If you wanted to see pictures of all <del>six</del> <del>eight</del> nine Transfort MAX buses, you are in luck! Please join me as we tour the fleet of North American Bus Industries vehicles. And no, I&#8217;m not the first person to <a href="http://www.citylab.com/commute/2014/01/bus-spotting-train-spotting-weirder/8021/" target="_blank">practice bus spotting</a>.

Aside: please raise your hand if you were also worried upon discovering the first verb in the first sentence on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Bus_Industries" target="_blank">NABI&#8217;s Wikipedia page</a> is in past tense. &#8220;NABI Bus, LLC (NABI) **was** a designer and producer of heavy-duty transit buses&#8230;&#8221; The NABI brand was discontinued in 2014 (the year the MAX opened) and its plants will now produce buses for its parent brand, New Flyer. I hope NABI spare parts were not also discontinued.

## MAX 79

    MAX 79 departing the South Transit Center. Bus 79 was my last bus to spot and I was getting anxious. Calmer pictures to follow!

## MAX 80

    MAX 80 at the South Transit Center. This AM-sunlit platform would be clutch during my season of bus spotting.

## MAX 81

    A northbound MAX 81 crossing Olive on Mason. Again, not a bus portrait studio, but necessary for completion. This intersection would serve me well in the future&#8230;

## MAX 82

  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    MAX 82, also northbound at Olive and Mason. I couldn&#8217;t have produced this motion panning effect even if I tried! And I definitely didn&#8217;t. (See MAX 81.) Let&#8217;s say I was hoping to produce a neat &#8220;we&#8217;re going places&#8221; effect for a Transfort promotional.

## MAX 83

  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    MAX 83 back at the sun-soaked South Transit Center. This is the only known photo of my shadow with a MAX bus. Except for the other three in this set I cropped it out of.

## MAX 84

<div style="width: 686px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

    MAX 84 at the&#8230;you guessed it&#8230;South Transit Center with a&#8230;you guessed it&#8230;tumbleweed. #colorado

## MAX 102

<div style="width: 686px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
  <img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.tyleragreen.com/blog_files/2016-03-transfort-buses/MAX_102.jpg?resize=676%2C507" alt="MAX 102 from the fleet of Transfort MAX buses" data-recalc-dims="1" />
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    MAX 102 at the South Transit Center on a day where the snow tainted its usually-pristine livery. MAX 103 peeps in from the rear. Buses 102 and 103 were ordered after the other six, which explains the gap in the fleet numbers.
  </p>
</div>

## MAX 103

<div style="width: 686px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
  <img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.tyleragreen.com/blog_files/2016-03-transfort-buses/MAX_103.jpg?resize=676%2C507" alt="MAX 103 from the fleet of Transfort MAX buses" data-recalc-dims="1" />
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    MAX 103 at the South Transit Center on the same sloppy morning. Doesn&#8217;t that sky just look cold? Bus 103 is currently the highest-numbered in the Transfort fleet.

And, a bonus&#8230;

## MAX 89: &#8220;MiniMAX&#8221;

<div style="width: 686px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
  <img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.tyleragreen.com/blog_files/2016-03-transfort-buses/MAX_89.jpg?resize=676%2C507" alt="MAX 89, also known as Mini MAX, from the fleet of Transfort MAX buses" data-recalc-dims="1" />
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    MAX 89 at the South Transit Center. Notice the lack of articulation? Because this is MiniMAX! The articulated buses are not run in the snow and this 40&#8242; replacement is the only (that I know of) non-articulated bus with the MAX livery. It was an unexpected treat to watch the snow fall through a backwards &#8220;max&#8221; during this ride!

If you&#8217;re wondering what kind of idyllic bus world the cover image to this post is from, the answer is Adobe Lightroom. Doesn&#8217;t this better-than-real image make you want to go ride a bus?

I&#8217;ll see you there.

**Ride on!**
