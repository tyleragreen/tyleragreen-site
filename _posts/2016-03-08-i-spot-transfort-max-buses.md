If you wanted to see pictures of all <del>six</del> <del>eight</del> nine Transfort MAX buses, you are in luck! Please join me as we tour the fleet of North American Bus Industries vehicles. And no, I'm not the first person to <a href="http://www.citylab.com/commute/2014/01/bus-spotting-train-spotting-weirder/8021/" target="_blank">practice bus spotting</a>.

Aside: please raise your hand if you were also worried upon discovering the first verb in the first sentence on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Bus_Industries" target="_blank">NABI's Wikipedia page</a> is in past tense. "NABI Bus, LLC (NABI) **was** a designer and producer of heavy-duty transit buses&#8230;" The NABI brand was discontinued in 2014 (the year the MAX opened) and its plants will now produce buses for its parent brand, New Flyer. I hope NABI spare parts were not also discontinued.

## MAX 79

  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    MAX 79 departing the South Transit Center. Bus 79 was my last bus to spot and I was getting anxious. Calmer pictures to follow!

## MAX 80

<div style="text-align:center">

  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    MAX 80 at the South Transit Center. This AM-sunlit platform would be clutch during my season of bus spotting.
  </p>
</div>

## MAX 81

<div style="text-align:center">

  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    A northbound MAX 81 crossing Olive on Mason. Again, not a bus portrait studio, but necessary for completion. This intersection would serve me well in the future&#8230;

## MAX 82

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="/assets/img/2016-03-08/MAX_82.jpg" alt="MAX 82 from the fleet of Transfort MAX buses" />
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    MAX 82, also northbound at Olive and Mason. I couldn't have produced this motion panning effect even if I tried! And I definitely didn't. (See MAX 81.) Let's say I was hoping to produce a neat "we're going places" effect for a Transfort promotional.
  </p>
</div>

## MAX 83

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="/assets/img/2016-03-08/MAX_83.jpg" alt="MAX 83 from the fleet of Transfort MAX buses" />
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    MAX 83 back at the sun-soaked South Transit Center. This is the only known photo of my shadow with a MAX bus. Except for the other three in this set I cropped it out of.
  </p>
</div>

## MAX 84

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="/assets/img/2016-03-08/MAX_84.jpg" alt="MAX 84 from the fleet of Transfort buses" />
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    MAX 84 at the&#8230;you guessed it&#8230;South Transit Center with a&#8230;you guessed it&#8230;tumbleweed. #colorado
  </p>
</div>

## MAX 102

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="/assets/img/2016-03-08/MAX_102.jpg" alt="MAX 102 from the fleet of Transfort MAX buses" />
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    MAX 102 at the South Transit Center on a day where the snow tainted its usually-pristine livery. MAX 103 peeps in from the rear. Buses 102 and 103 were ordered after the other six, which explains the gap in the fleet numbers.
  </p>
</div>

## MAX 103

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="/assets/img/2016-03-08/MAX_103.jpg" alt="MAX 103 from the fleet of Transfort MAX buses" />
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    MAX 103 at the South Transit Center on the same sloppy morning. Doesn't that sky just look cold? Bus 103 is currently the highest-numbered in the Transfort fleet.
  </p>
</div>

And, a bonus&#8230;

## MAX 89: "MiniMAX"

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="/assets/img/2016-03-08/MAX_89.jpg" alt="MAX 89, also known as Mini MAX, from the fleet of Transfort MAX buses" />
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    MAX 89 at the South Transit Center. Notice the lack of articulation? Because this is MiniMAX! The articulated buses are not run in the snow and this 40&#8242; replacement is the only (that I know of) non-articulated bus with the MAX livery. It was an unexpected treat to watch the snow fall through a backwards "max" during this ride!

If you're wondering what kind of idyllic bus world the image below is from, the answer is Adobe Lightroom. Doesn't this better-than-real image make you want to go ride a bus?

I'll see you there.

**Ride on!**
