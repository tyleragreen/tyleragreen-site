Last Wednesday, I rode the Amtrak Northeast Regional to our nation&#8217;s capital to attend my first <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Transportation-Techies/" target="_blank">Transportation Techies</a> meetup! <a href="http://mvjantzen.com/" target="_blank">Michael</a> had been urging me to attend since we first met at <a href="http://www.tyleragreen.com/blog/2016/05/next-stop-transitland-a-transportationcamp-colorado-presentation/" target="_blank">TransportationCamp Colorado 2016</a>. Now that I&#8217;m on the east coast, it was an easy trip!

Michael always puts on an incredible event and Metro Hack Night VII was no exception! We had a great <a href="http://mvjantzen.com/meetup/metrohacknight7.html" target="_blank">line-up</a> and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mvjantzen/37248206144/" target="_blank">turnout</a>. I presented on how we can use graph theory to study transit networks, specifically WMATA Metrorail <a href="https://gtfs-graph.herokuapp.com/rank/dcp/" target="_blank">with</a> and <a href="https://gtfs-graph.herokuapp.com/rank/dc/" target="_blank">without</a> the Purple line.

You can browse my slides below, or <a href="http://www.tyleragreen.com/blog_files/2017-10-transit-techies/gtfs-graph_TylerGreen.pdf" target="_blank">download the PDF deck</a>.

All the presenters blew me away with their excellent, excellent projects. The DC transit developer community is special and I loved getting to experience it for one night. You can read about the all projects and presenters in this <a href="https://mobilitylab.org/2017/10/27/techies-better-ways-figure-catch-metro-train/" target="_blank">write-up from Mobility Lab</a>.

If you live in the DC region (or anywhere along the Northeast Corridor), I encourage you to drop in for the next gathering of the Transportation Techies!
