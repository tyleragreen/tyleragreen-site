I attended the inaugural <a href="http://transportationcamp.org/events/colorado-2016/" target="_blank">TransportationCamp Colorado</a> was last week! Sticking with the format of an "unconference," attendees were encouraged to propose their own sessions to present their work and/or lead discussions. I took them up on the format and presented the following slides on <a href="https://transit.land/" target="_blank">Transitland</a> and how I used it to create my <a href="/maps/new_york/" target="_blank">New York City transit frequency visualization</a>. We had a really great interactive session with many good ideas exchanged!

Some stories and explanations were left off the slides. Feel free to <a href="/#connect" target="_blank">hit me up</a>Â for more explanation on anything!
